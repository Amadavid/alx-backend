0x00. Pagination
Definition
Pagination, also sometimes called paging, refers to the method of dividing
a large set of data (like search results, product listings, or blog posts)
into manageable chunks and displaying them across multiple pages.

Here's how it works:
Data is divided:

A large dataset is split into smaller subsets based on a chosen number of items per page (often called the page size).
Pages are created:

Each subset becomes its own separate page, typically numbered sequentially.
Navigation is provided:

Users can navigate between pages using controls like page numbers or "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
This allows them to find and access specific portions of the data set efficiently.
Benefits of pagination:
Improved performance:

By loading data in smaller chunks, pagination helps websites render pages faster, especially for datasets with many entries.
Enhanced user experience:

Large amounts of information on a single page can be overwhelming.
Pagination makes it easier for users to browse and digest information in smaller, more manageable sections.
Better accessibility:

Pagination aids users with screen readers or assistive technologies by allowing them to navigate through content in smaller parts.
